# AI-Powered-Recommendation-System

Description
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that allows users to filter and discover movies based on various criteria such as genre, actor, director, language, and rating. It also includes a content-based recommendation engine that suggests movies similar to a given title based on genre similarity. Built using Python and Pandas, this system is a great example of how data filtering and recommendation algorithms can be applied to real-world datasets.

Features
Filter Movies: Filter movies by genre, actor, director, language, or rating range.
Recommend Similar Movies: Get recommendations for movies similar to a given title based on genre similarity.
Random Movie Suggestion: Discover a random movie from the dataset.
User-Friendly Interface: Interactive command-line interface for easy navigation.

Tech Stack
Python: Primary programming language.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: Used for TF-IDF and cosine similarity calculations (for recommendations).
